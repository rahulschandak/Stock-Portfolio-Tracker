# Stock-Analysis-Application
A prototype desktop application to demonstrate various Java design principles and MVC design architecture to perform CRUD operations and visualize the data using real-time stocks. 

Real-time stock prices were retrieved from the AlphaVantage API and portfolio details were stored and retrieved from XML. 

The design was open to access the features using the command line and graphical user interface (or any other UI if in the future). GUI was implemented using Java Swing.

Note: To follow the university's academic integrity policy, the source code has been kept private. If any details/ doubts pertaining to the project is required I request you to please ping me on LinkedIn.
